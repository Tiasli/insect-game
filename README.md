# bugs-ecosystem

This is a game where the enemy (a human hand) tries to hit and squish you, a simple insect. 
You try to use whatever tactics your insect have against the hand.

This is an ongoing project where I try to learn about OOP methods.
Enemy and fight mechanics have yet to be coded. 
Classes and insect types are updated.
